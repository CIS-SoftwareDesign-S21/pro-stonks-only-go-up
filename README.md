# Stonks Only Go Up

With the events of /r/wallstreetbets hitting the mainstream over short squeezing of GME and AMC, there has been increased interest and scrutiny of social media's impact on retail investors and the larger market. Various subreddits for different types of investors, Tiktok traders, and Twitter feeds have become some of the more popular forms of information. We aim to scrape the information off certain subreddits, feeds, and popular social media trades to identify which individual stocks are trending. Then using live market data, we will create a paper trading account to simulate what happens if we trade on that information. We plan to set up several different strategies based on timing, whether sentiment is similar across platforms, whether there are any outliers which correlate stronger with positive trades, and whether there are particular financial vehicles (crypto, options, pennystocks, stonks) that are more susceptible.

## Vision

For individual hobbyists who are interested in the potential applications of data science when it comes to analyzing the impact of social media on the market, "Stonks Only Go Up" is a web-based application that provides sentiment analysis on trending stocks with a paper trading integration to test how reliable this information can predict market outcomes. Unlike many other trading applications that utilize machine-learning algorithms for market forecasting, Stonks Only Go Up will remain free and open-source.

  Harold, age 65, is a retired bank teller with a moderately-sized nest egg which he grew from long-term, traditional, investing practices. He had some trouble adapting when his bank went digital, but became proficient at using simple data entry and organization software. However, his computer skills do not extend much further, as the concept of the internet is a bit confusing for him. He prefers the paper and television-based news sources for obtaining the latest stock information. When in doubt, he'll call his broker.

  Having worked at a bank for most of his career, Harold has heard his fair share of investment advice. With day-trading being faster-paced than ever, Harold feels that he needs to listen in on the online conversation to keep up with young investors. Wanting to keep busy and to grow his retirement fund without breaking his back, Harold seeks out a simplified way of keeping up with the social-media influence that has taken over the world of day-trading. He feels that if he can understand the impact that social media posts have on stocks, he can apply his conventional trading knowledge to make some money.
