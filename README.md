# Stonks Only Go Up

With the events of /r/wallstreetbets hitting the mainstream over short squeezing of GME and AMC, there has been increased interest and scrutiny of social media's impact on retail investors and the larger market. Various subreddits for different types of investors, Tiktok traders, and Twitter feeds have become some of the more popular forms of information. We aim to scrape the information off certain subreddits, feeds, and popular social media trades to identify which individual stocks are trending. Then using live market data, we will create a paper trading account to simulate what happens if we trade on that information. We plan to set up several different strategies based on timing, whether sentiment is similar across platforms, whether there are any outliers which correlate stronger with positive trades, and whether there are particular financial vehicles (crypto, options, pennystocks, stonks) that are more susceptible.

## Vision

For individual hobbyists who are interested in the potential applications of data science when it comes to analyzing the impact of social media on the market, "Stonks Only Go Up" is a web-based application that provides sentiment analysis on trending stocks with a paper trading integration to test how reliable this information can predict market outcomes. Unlike many other trading applications that utilize machine-learning algorithms for market forecasting, Stonks Only Go Up will remain free and open-source.
